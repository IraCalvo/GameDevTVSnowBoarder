Class Game

This game is like the popular website game 'Happy Wheels' where the player's object is to get to point A to Point B without falling on their head.
This game features:
-WASD Movement
-Collision boxes to determine which collision was triggered
-Character gravity and velocity
This game really just solidified the understanding of collisions within Unity and knowledge of C#
